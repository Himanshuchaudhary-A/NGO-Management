    <h4>What is an NGO??</h4>
    <br>
    
    A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a non-profit group that functions independently of any government. NGOs, sometimes called civil societies, are organized on community, national and international levels to serve a social or political goal such as humanitarian causes or the environment.
   </p>
   <p>
    <h4>How NGOs are Funded?</h4>
    <br>
    As non-profits, NGOs rely on a variety of sources for funding, including:
    <ol>
     <li>membership dues</li>
    <li> private donations </li> 
    <li>the sale of goods and services</li>
    <li>grants</li>
</ol>  
    Despite their independence from governments, some NGOs rely heavily on government funding. Large NGOs may have budgets in the millions or billions of dollars.
   </p>


   <p>
    <h4>Types of NGOs</h4>
A number of variations of the NGO acronym exist, including:

INGO: An international NGO. For example, the Conference of INGOs of the Council of Europe is comprised of more than 300 participating INGOs. <br>
GONGO: This means government-organized NGO, often derogatory. Foreign Policy describes GONGOs as a government-backed NGOs set up to advocate on the behalf of a repressive regime in the international. <br>


QUANGO: Chiefly a British term, often derogatory. A quango is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization that relies on public funding. Its senior officials are appointed by the government. A Financial Times opinion piece writes that quangos are seen as useless and are often staffed by quangocrats. <br>
ENGO: An environmental NGO, for example, Greenpeace or the World Wildlife Fund. Both groups operate internationally in addition to advocating for the environment. They are often simply referred to as NGOs.
   </p>

   <h4>Level of operation:</h4>
   <p>
    Community-based organizations (CBOs) — popular initiatives which can raise the consciousness of the urban poor, helping them understand their right to services. <br>
    City-wide organizations — include chambers of commerce and industry, coalitions of business, ethnic or educational groups, and community organizations. <br>
    State NGOs — include state-level organizations, associations, and groups. Some state NGOs are guided by national and international NGOs. <br>
    National NGOs — an NGO that exists in only one country; they are rare.[19] These include national organizations such as YMCAs and YWCAs, professional associations, and similar groups. Some have state or city branches, and assist local NGOs. <br>
    International NGOs (INGOs) — range from secular agencies, such as Save the Children, to religious groups. They may fund local NGOs, institutions and projects, and implement projects.</p>
   
        
       <h4>Why is it important that we donate to charity? </h4> 
       <p>
       <ol  style="list-style-type: square;">
           <li>Help other people – there are millions of people in the world who are worse of than we are at any one time. Many of these folk have problems that are not their fault or are beyond their ability to prevent or change. Humans are a social animal and the best way for mankind to advance is by helping those who are unable to help themselves. We have a responsibility to care for other people, to help those less fortunate than ourselves. When we have some spare cash, time or goods, it is an opportunity to help out.  </li>  <br>
            <li>Make a difference – donating to charity is the perfect opportunity to make a difference in the world. By making a difference to someone’s life, you are leaving behind a legacy. You are making a statement that your life was worthwhile because you made a contribution to society. </li> <br>
             <li>  Feel good – medical and scientific research has proven beyond doubt that giving to other people makes you feel good. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you help someone else is hard to replicate with any other type of activity or endeavor. People who give feel happier, are less anxious and suffer less depression than those who don’t. Better health is enjoyed by those who donate their time, expertise or money to others who are in need. Charitable people tend to be able to cope with their own problems more easily than those who don’t donate. Giving to others improves your self-esteem, self confidence and self worth. This advantage flows into all areas of your life so you will find that you are more confident at work and in social situations.</li>   <br>
               <li>Support a cause you believe in – different charities touch the heart of different people. If you are passionate about something or believe that a certain area is important, you will be able to support that cause by donating to charity. You might be passionate about every child having access to a good education; that nobody should live in poverty in the 21st century; that everyone should be able to experience music or art. Whatever you believe in or are passionate about, you will be able to further the cause through donations to charity. </li><br>
<li>Meet new people – donations to charity give you the opportunity to met new people and expand your circle of acquaintances. This is especially true when you donate your time or expertise to a worthy cause. While most charitable organizations always need money, many could not operate without an army of volunteers. Whether you give up your time one day a week to serve meals, give a few hours a day to sit with the elderly or travel overseas to help build houses, you will certainly meet many like-minded people along the way. As well as being potential friends, who knows where these new relationships will take you and how these new people might be able to help you in the future? </li><br>
